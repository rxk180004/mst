I. Files List
 	MST.java
	BinaryHeap.java
	Readme.txt
 
II. How to Run the Project
	1. Compile the following java file in any IDE (eg: Eclipse)
	2. Run the file MST.java using run command from the same IDE.
	
	

Description:-
The following Algorithms are used to find Minimum Spanning Tree:
1. Kruskals Algorithm - Uses the sorted edges to find MST
2. Prim Take 1 - Uses Priority Queue of Edges to find MST 
3. Prim Take 2 - Uses Priority Queue of Vertices to find MST
4. Prim Take 3 - Uses Indexed Heap of Vertices to find MST
